## Tour agency

### The travel agency has a catalog of Tours. For the catalog, implement the option of selecting tours:

* by type (rest, excursion, shopping);
* by price;
* by the number of people;
* by type of hotel.

### The customer 
* registered in the system
* selects the Tour and makes an Order
* has a personal account which contains a brief information about the user, as well as a list of tours and their current status (registered, paid, canceled).

After ordering, the tour has the status of 'registered'
An unregistered user is not able to book a tour.

### The manager
* defines the tour as 'hot'
* hot tours are always displayed at the top of the list.
* transfers the status of the tour from 'registered' to 'paid' or 'canceled'

For each tour ordered, a discount is determined with a step determined by the manager, but not more than a percentage, which the manager also determines.

### The system administrator owns the rights with the same rights as the manager, and can also:
* Add / remove tour, change tour information;
* Block / unblock user.
